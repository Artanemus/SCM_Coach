# ERStudio Project File

Location of the Coach ERStudio project file can be found at the ...

* https://github.com/Artanemus/SCM_ERStudio

All Artanemus database designs for the SCM project are held here. ERStudio projects are centralized here as it makes for quick access and convenance.

This repo is currently set to private. If you would like a copy of the current SCM_Coach ERStudio project file, please contact the developer. Typically most programmers who visit this project don't have a lot of experience with this utility and I didn't want to clutter this repo with it's nonsense.

SQL scripts for the most recent build of the Coach DataBase (a creation script with DB schema generated by ERStudio) can be found in this repo. It's located in the SQL_BUILD folder. Also in this folder you will find other useful scripts that generate starter data.
Cheers

Artanemus.
