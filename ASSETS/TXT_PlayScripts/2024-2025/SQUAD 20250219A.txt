1x10M SCULL

-Scull with Head-Up FS Kick – Combine sculling with a strong flutter kick to simulate maintaining body position while engaging the hands.
-Scull with Dolphin Kick – Swimmers use a steady dolphin kick while sculling in the front, mid, or rear position to build stroke coordination.
-3-Stage Sculling – Swimmers move through front scull, mid-scull, and rear scull in one length, reinforcing the full stroke cycle.
-Sculling with a Pull Buoy – Placing a pull buoy between the legs removes leg assistance, forcing swimmers to rely purely on their sculling technique.
-Sculling with One Arm Extended – One arm sculls while the other stays extended in a streamline, mimicking a single-arm drill for strokes like FS and FLY.
