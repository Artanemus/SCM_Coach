FOR SWIMMERS WHO HAVEN'T SWUM THE 'SPECIAL COURSE'
(STILL ON WHITEBOARD)
RULES: 
    - SWIM WHAT YOU CAN.
    - FIND A STEADY PACE THAT YOU ARE HAPPY WITH.
    - NO SKIPPING SECTIONS OR CHANGING COURSE.
    - NO FINS.
    - BE HONEST - DON'T DO A 'BRUCE'.
    - RETIRE IF EXHAUSTED ... GO PLAY
    - IF YOU FINISH BEFORE THE HOUR ... GO PLAY.

WHAT IS A 'BRUCE'.
- lies about how much was swum 
- walks the pool
- never swims to end
- 'touch and go' - 'what?' 
- bobs about in the middle of a lap
.... do you known a bruce?
