Sometimes on meets they use the 2nd pool for practice of turns (unfortunate - not the o. It can be difficault to find a land clear for block starts. 

Bundamba Swim & Gym Centre, 256 Brisbane Rd, Bundamba QLD 4304

To my knowledge, the pool is 50m in length. That's probably why the program title for the event is 'Long Course Preparation Meet'.

Probabaly sebastian is swimming too many events. As 100BS and 50FS follow fairly close together - perhaps one of these events should be dropped? 
MAYBE - The meet has good attendance, with many heats to swim and Sebastians recovery time won't be an issue?

Events are spaced - Good recover time.

IMPORTANT GENERAL NOTES:
When practising turns 
	- work at the correct end
	- take note of the overhead flags There colors and position from ends
	- take note of the different lane rope colors used at each end of the pool
	- take note of the pool markings, on the bottom and end of the pool.
Pools vary in markings and lane ropes. 
Water depth can alter your perception of where the pool end is.

Find the middle of the pool. Is there an expansion join at the half way point? If not, check for a side pool reference. When pacing the 200m swim, knowning the half way point is important. 

Knowing where the 10m point before touch is also eccential. That's when you will be swimming on a single breath (FS) to win the race. In BS, you'll use the 15M mark to focus on pushing your arms forward - on the recovery stage - to charge-up the glide portion of the stroke. 

What type of starter blocks are they using? Be aware - starter blocks can vary in height and pitch.
